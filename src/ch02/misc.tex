The TEM is a new platform that provides the guarantees associated with trusted
execution, even in the case that the user requiring trusted execution is not the
platform's owner. This is achieved by building a very small TCB (Trusted
Computing Base) which can be enclosed in a secure envelope at commodity prices.

The TEM can be presented in a way that avoids the social protest met by most
secure platforms. The TEM is an add-on that does not to be permanently bound to
its host computer, so people will not feel that their ownership of the main
computer is limited.

On the other hand, most people are used to giving out their credit card number
to perform online transactions, so the TEM can be positioned as an
equivalent of a credit card, namely, the add-on has to be present so that other
users can trust the owner.
