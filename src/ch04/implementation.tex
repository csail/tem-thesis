\chapter{Prototype Implementation}\label{impl}
The Trusted Execution Module is not just a collection of abstract ideas. I have
implemented the complete TEM architecture described in chapter \ref{arch} in a
thumb-sized tamper-resistant chip that can be mass-produced at a unit cost of
less than 5 USD.

The prototype implementation served as a platform for experimentation
throughout the TEM's development, and provides concrete proof that the
proposed TEM design is practical.

The prototype TEM implementation consists of the following software modules:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The TEM architecure described in chapter \ref{arch} is implemented by
  the firmware running on the secure chip. The firmware is implemented on
  top of the JavaCard platform \cite{microsystems2003jcp}, and is described in
  section \ref{impl:firmware}.
  \item An extension implementing smartcard access for the Ruby programming
  language. Section \ref{impl:rubygem} explains the features and motivation
  for developing the extension. 
  \item Driver software for the TEM's host computer, implemented in the Ruby
  programming language \cite{flanagan2008ruby}. Section \ref{impl:driver}
  describes the advanced features that make this driver implementation unique.
  \item Demonstration software using the TEM driver, summarized in section
  \ref{impl:demos}.
\end{itemize}
