The Trusted Execution Module (TEM) is a high-level specification for a
commodity chip that can execute user-supplied procedures in a trusted
environment. The TEM draws inspiration from the Trusted Platform Module (TPM),
the first security-related hardware that has gained massive adoption in the PC
market. However, the TEM is capable of securely executing procedures expressing
arbitrary computation, originating from a potentially untrusted party, whereas
the TPM is limited to a set of cryptographic functions that is fixed at
design-time. Despite its greater flexibility, the TEM design was implemented on
the same inexpensive off-the-shelf hardware as the TPM, and it does not require
any export-restricted technology. Furthermore, the TEM removes the expensive
requirement of a secure binding to it  host computer. This makes TEM a great
candidate for the next-generation TPM. However, the TEM's guarantees of
secure execution enable exciting applications that were far beyond the reach of
TPM-powered systems. The applications include but are not limited to mobile
agents, peer-to-peer multiplayer online games, and anonymous offline payments.
